Machine learning project on census income prediciton

1) Problem statement : 

Given the feature vector, the goal is to build the machine learning model to 
predict the income group.


2) Data exploration and manipulation

The dataset used for this project was acquired from UCI machine learning repository. 
Train dataset has  32561 rows and 14  columns (features) while test data set has 16281 rows.
Classifiation task is binary classification problem, i.e, to predict weather the income 
level is above 50k or below. 

Further analyzing the class distribution, the ratio of two class (income less than 50k 
to income more than 50K) is found to be 3:1. 

Bar charts were plotted for different categorical variables in adjeacent with dependent 
variables. Similarly, histograms were also plotted for continous variables. 


3 ) Predictive modeling

Random forest and xgboost model have good majority class prediction accuracy. However, they 
both have disappoininting  minority class prediction accuracy. In order to over come 
the class imbalance in dataset, SMOTE sampling technique was used and both models were fitted 
again in sampled dataset. This didn't lead to cosiderable improvemnt in predicting minority 
class. 
Finally, different cut off probability for prediciton was used as the threshold of 0.5
 will always favor the majority class since the probability of a minority class
 is quite low. xgboost model With 0.4 threshold returned better predictions than
 previous xgboost model at 0.5 threshold.
